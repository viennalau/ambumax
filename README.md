<H1>Ambumax</H1>

WIP Robotics Project!

Ambumax consists of an ambulance and Baymax from Big Hero 6. Baymax sits on top of a remote control car designed to appear as an ambulance. Developed a Pygame-based GUI for remote vehicle control using keyboard inputs and monitored the vehicle’s location through a connected camera. Implemented threading to continuously gather distance data from an ultrasonic sensor and dynamically adjust the vehicle’s speed. 

Future plans include turning the vehicle as it approaches an object, AI to detect road lines, and AI for Baymax, which will take input through a microphone and provide output through a speaker. In this project, we hope to create an AI-driven remote car and Baymax to accompany hospitalized patients, primarily within the Pediatrics wing.
